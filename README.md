# Movie Search and Details App

This project is a responsive movie search and details application built using Next.js 15 and the TMDB API. It features a clean user interface, infinite scrolling for movie lists, and detailed movie information, including cast and recommendations.

There is some problem in running this TMDB api on indian IP.

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

-   Clone the repository:

-   Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

-   Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add your TMDB API key:

```text
TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

-   Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
